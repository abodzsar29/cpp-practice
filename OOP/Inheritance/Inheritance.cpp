// Inheritance
// The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class
// It supports the concept of “reusability”

// 3 modes of inheritance:
// Public: Public members of the base class will become public in the derived class and protected members of the base class will become protected in the derived class
// Protected: Public and protected members of the base class will become protected in the derived class
// Private: Public and Protected members of the base class will become private in the derived class. They can only be accessed by the member functions of the derived class
// Private mode is the default mode that is applied when we don’t specify any mode.
// Private members won't be inherited in any mode
